Description: Easy-to-use, electronic design software.
Fritzing is an open source project designed to help one transition from a prototype to a finished project. Aimed at users who want to produce or document circuits and experiments, one starts by building a physical prototype, then recreating it with Fritzingâ€™s graphical editor. From there one can generate a schematic, PCB artwork, and PCB production files.
