            //    The Image Attribute Subpacket is used to encode an image, presumably
            //    (but not required to be) that of the key owner.
            //
            //    The Image Attribute Subpacket begins with an image header. The first
            //    two octets of the image header contain the length of the image
            //    header. Note that unlike other multi-octet numerical values in this
            //    document, due to a historical accident this value is encoded as a
            //    little-endian number. The image header length is followed by a
            //    single octet for the image header version. The only currently
            //    defined version of the image header is 1, which is a 16-octet image
            //    header. The first three octets of a version 1 image header are thus
            //    0x10, 0x00, 0x01.
            //
            //    The fourth octet of a version 1 image header designates the encoding
            //    format of the image. The only currently defined encoding format is
            //    the value 1 to indicate JPEG. Image format types 100 through 110 are
            //    reserved for private or experimental use. The rest of the version 1
            //    image header is made up of 12 reserved octets, all of which MUST be
            //    set to 0.
            //
            //    The rest of the image Subpacket contains the image itself. As the
            //    only currently defined image type is JPEG, the image is encoded in
            //    the JPEG File Interchange Format (JFIF), a standard file format for
            //    JPEG images [JFIF].
            //
            //    An implementation MAY try to determine the type of an image by
            //    examination of the image data if it is unable to handle a particular
            //    version of the image header or if a specified encoding format value
            //    is not recognized.
