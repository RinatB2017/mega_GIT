            //    This Subpacket denotes whether a certification signature is
            //    "exportable", to be used by other users than the signature’s issuer.
            //    The packet body contains a Boolean flag indicating whether the
            //    signature is exportable. If this packet is not present, the
            //    certification is exportable; it is equivalent to a flag containing a
            //    1.
            //
            //    Non-exportable, or "local", certifications are signatures made by a
            //    user to mark a key as valid within that user’s implementation only.
            //    Thus, when an implementation prepares a user’s copy of a key for
            //    transport to another user (this is the process of "exporting" the
            //    key), any local certification signatures are deleted from the key.
            //
            //    The receiver of a transported key "imports" it, and likewise trims
            //    any local certifications. In normal operation, there won’t be any,
            //    assuming the import is performed on an exported key. However, there
            //    are instances where this can reasonably happen. For example, if an
            //    implementation allows keys to be imported from a key database in
            //    addition to an exported key, then this situation can arise.
            //
            //    Some implementations do not represent the interest of a single user
            //    (for example, a key server). Such implementations always trim local
            //    certifications from any key they handle.
