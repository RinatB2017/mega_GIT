        //    An experimental version of PGP used this packet as the Literal
        //    packet, but no released version of PGP generated Literal packets with
        //    this tag.  With PGP 5.x, this packet has been reassigned and is
        //    reserved for use as the Marker packet.
        //
        //    The body of this packet consists of:
        //
        //      - The three octets 0x50, 0x47, 0x50 (which spell "PGP" in UTF-8).
        //
        //    Such a packet MUST be ignored when received.  It may be placed at the
        //    beginning of a message that uses features not available in PGP 2.6.x
        //    in order to cause that version to report that newer software is
        //    necessary to process the message.
