Fritzing is an open-source initiative to support designers, artists, researchers
and hobbyists to work creatively with interactive electronics. We are creating a
software and website in the spirit of Processing and Arduino, developing a tool
that allows users to document their prototypes, share them with others, teach
electronics in a classroom, and to create a pcb layout for professional
manufacturing.
