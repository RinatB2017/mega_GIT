        // 5.13.  Sym. Encrypted Integrity Protected Data Packet (Tag 18)
        //
        //    The Symmetrically Encrypted Integrity Protected Data packet is a
        //    variant of the Symmetrically Encrypted Data packet.  It is a new
        //    feature created for OpenPGP that addresses the problem of detecting a
        //    modification to encrypted data.  It is used in combination with a
        //    Modification Detection Code packet.
        //
        //    There is a corresponding feature in the features Signature subpacket
        //    that denotes that an implementation can properly use this packet
        //    type.  An implementation MUST support decrypting these packets and
        //    SHOULD prefer generating them to the older Symmetrically Encrypted
        //    Data packet when possible.  Since this data packet protects against
        //    modification attacks, this standard encourages its proliferation.
        //    While blanket adoption of this data packet would create
        //    interoperability problems, rapid adoption is nevertheless important.
        //    An implementation SHOULD specifically denote support for this packet,
        //    but it MAY infer it from other mechanisms.
        //
        //    For example, an implementation might infer from the use of a cipher
        //    such as Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) or Twofish that a user
        //    supports this feature.  It might place in the unhashed portion of
        //    another user's key signature a Features subpacket.  It might also
        //    present a user with an opportunity to regenerate their own self-
        //    signature with a Features subpacket.
        //
        //    This packet contains data encrypted with a symmetric-key algorithm
        //    and protected against modification by the SHA-1 hash algorithm.  When
        //    it has been decrypted, it will typically contain other packets (often
        //    a Literal Data packet or Compressed Data packet).  The last decrypted
        //    packet in this packet's payload MUST be a Modification Detection Code
        //    packet.
        //
        //    The body of this packet consists of:
        //
        //      - A one-octet version number.  The only currently defined value is
        //        1.
        //
        //      - Encrypted data, the output of the selected symmetric-key cipher
        //        operating in Cipher Feedback mode with shift amount equal to the
        //        block size of the cipher (CFB-n where n is the block size).
        //
        //    The symmetric cipher used MUST be specified in a Public-Key or
        //    Symmetric-Key Encrypted Session Key packet that precedes the
        //    Symmetrically Encrypted Data packet.  In either case, the cipher
        //    algorithm octet is prefixed to the session key before it is
        //    encrypted.
        //
        //    The data is encrypted in CFB mode, with a CFB shift size equal to the
        //    cipher's block size.  The Initial Vector (IV) is specified as all
        //    zeros.  Instead of using an IV, OpenPGP prefixes an octet string to
        //    the data before it is encrypted.  The length of the octet string
        //    equals the block size of the cipher in octets, plus two.  The first
        //    octets in the group, of length equal to the block size of the cipher,
        //    are random; the last two octets are each copies of their 2nd
        //    preceding octet.  For example, with a cipher whose block size is 128
        //    bits or 16 octets, the prefix data will contain 16 random octets,
        //    then two more octets, which are copies of the 15th and 16th octets,
        //    respectively.  Unlike the Symmetrically Encrypted Data Packet, no
        //    special CFB resynchronization is done after encrypting this prefix
        //    data.  See "OpenPGP CFB Mode" below for more details.
        //
        //    The repetition of 16 bits in the random data prefixed to the message
        //    allows the receiver to immediately check whether the session key is
        //    incorrect.
        //
        //    The plaintext of the data to be encrypted is passed through the SHA-1
        //    hash function, and the result of the hash is appended to the
        //    plaintext in a Modification Detection Code packet.  The input to the
        //    hash function includes the prefix data described above; it includes
        //    all of the plaintext, and then also includes two octets of values
        //    0xD3, 0x14.  These represent the encoding of a Modification Detection
        //    Code packet tag and length field of 20 octets.
        //
        //    The resulting hash value is stored in a Modification Detection Code
        //    (MDC) packet, which MUST use the two octet encoding just given to
        //    represent its tag and length field.  The body of the MDC packet is
        //    the 20-octet output of the SHA-1 hash.
        //
        //    The Modification Detection Code packet is appended to the plaintext
        //    and encrypted along with the plaintext using the same CFB context.
        //
        //    During decryption, the plaintext data should be hashed with SHA-1,
        //    including the prefix data as well as the packet tag and length field
        //    of the Modification Detection Code packet.  The body of the MDC
        //    packet, upon decryption, is compared with the result of the SHA-1
        //    hash.
        //
        //    Any failure of the MDC indicates that the message has been modified
        //    and MUST be treated as a security problem.  Failures include a
        //    difference in the hash values, but also the absence of an MDC packet,
        //    or an MDC packet in any position other than the end of the plaintext.
        //    Any failure SHOULD be reported to the user.
        //
        //    Note: future designs of new versions of this packet should consider
        //    rollback attacks since it will be possible for an attacker to change
        //    the version back to 1.
