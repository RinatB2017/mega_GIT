            //    Signer asserts that the key is not only valid but also trustworthy at
            //    the specified level. Level 0 has the same meaning as an ordinary
            //    validity signature. Level 1 means that the signed key is asserted to
            //    be a valid trusted introducer, with the 2nd octet of the body
            //    specifying the degree of trust. Level 2 means that the signed key is
            //    asserted to be trusted to issue level 1 trust signatures, i.e., that
            //    it is a "meta introducer". Generally, a level n trust signature
            //    asserts that a key is trusted to issue level n-1 trust signatures.
            //    The trust amount is in a range from 0-255, interpreted such that
            //    values less than 120 indicate partial trust and values of 120 or
            //    greater indicate complete trust. Implementations SHOULD emit values
            //    of 60 for partial trust and 120 for complete trust.
