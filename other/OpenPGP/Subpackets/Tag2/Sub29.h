            //    (1 octet of revocation code, N octets of reason string)
            //
            //    This Subpacket is used only in key revocation and certification
            //    revocation signatures.  It describes the reason why the key or
            //    certificate was revoked.
            //
            //    The first octet contains a machine-readable code that denotes the
            //    reason for the revocation:
            //
            //         0  - No reason specified (key revocations or cert revocations)
            //         1  - Key is superseded (key revocations)
            //         2  - Key material has been compromised (key revocations)
            //         3  - Key is retired and no longer used (key revocations)
            //         32 - User ID information is no longer valid (cert revocations)
            //    100-110 - Private Use
            //
            //    Following the revocation code is a string of octets that gives
            //    information about the Reason for Revocation in human-readable form
            //    (UTF-8).  The string may be null, that is, of zero length.  The
            //    length of the Subpacket is the length of the reason string plus one.
            //    An implementation SHOULD implement this Subpacket, include it in all
            //    revocation signatures, and interpret revocations appropriately.
            //    There are important semantic differences between the reasons, and
            //    there are thus important reasons for revoking signatures.
            //
            //    If a key has been revoked because of a compromise, all signatures
            //    created by that key are suspect.  However, if it was merely
            //    superseded or retired, old signatures are still valid.  If the
            //    revoked signature is the self-signature for certifying a User ID, a
            //    revocation denotes that that user name is no longer in use.  Such a
            //    revocation SHOULD include a 0x20 code.
            //
            //    Note that any signature may be revoked, including a certification on
            //    some other person's key.  There are many good reasons for revoking a
            //    certification signature, such as the case where the keyholder leaves
            //    the employ of a business with an email address.  A revoked
            //    certification is no longer a part of validity calculations.
