        //
        //    A Public-Subkey packet (tag 14) has exactly the same format as a
        //    Public-Key packet, but denotes a subkey.  One or more subkeys may be
        //    associated with a top-level key.  By convention, the top-level key
        //    provides signature services, and the subkeys provide encryption
        //    services.
        //
        //    Note: in PGP 2.6.x, tag 14 was intended to indicate a comment
        //    packet.  This tag was selected for reuse because no previous version
        //    of PGP ever emitted comment packets but they did properly ignore
        //    them.  Public-Subkey packets are ignored by PGP 2.6.x and do not
        //    cause it to fail, providing a limited degree of backward
        //    compatibility.
