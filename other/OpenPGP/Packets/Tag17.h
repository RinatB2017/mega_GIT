        // 5.12. User Attribute Packet (Tag 17)
        //
        //    The User Attribute packet is a variation of the User ID packet. It
        //    is capable of storing more types of data than the User ID packet,
        //    which is limited to text. Like the User ID packet, a User Attribute
        //    packet may be certified by the key owner ("self-signed") or any other
        //    key owner who cares to certify it. Except as noted, a User Attribute
        //    packet may be used anywhere that a User ID packet may be used.
        //
        //    While User Attribute packets are not a required part of the OpenPGP
        //    standard, implementations SHOULD provide at least enough
        //    compatibility to properly handle a certification signature on the
        //    User Attribute packet. A simple way to do this is by treating the
        //    User Attribute packet as a User ID packet with opaque contents, but
        //    an implementation may use any method desired.
        //
        //    The User Attribute packet is made up of one or more attribute
        //    subpackets. Each subpacket consists of a subpacket header and a
        //    body. The header consists of:
        //
        //      - the subpacket length (1, 2, or 5 octets)
        //
        //      - the subpacket type (1 octet)
        //
        //    and is followed by the subpacket specific data.
        //
        //    The only currently defined subpacket type is 1, signifying an image.
        //    An implementation SHOULD ignore any subpacket of a type that it does
        //    not recognize. Subpacket types 100 through 110 are reserved for
        //    private or experimental use.
