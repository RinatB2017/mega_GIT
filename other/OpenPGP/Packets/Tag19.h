        // 5.14. Modification Detection Code Packet (Tag 19)
        //
        //    The Modification Detection Code packet contains a SHA-1 hash of
        //    plaintext data, which is used to detect message modification. It is
        //    only used with a Symmetrically Encrypted Integrity Protected Data
        //    packet. The Modification Detection Code packet MUST be the last
        //    packet in the plaintext data that is encrypted in the Symmetrically
        //    Encrypted Integrity Protected Data packet, and MUST appear in no
        //    other place.
        //
        //    A Modification Detection Code packet MUST have a length of 20 octets.
        //    The body of this packet consists of:
        //
        //      - A 20-octet SHA-1 hash of the preceding plaintext data of the
        //        Symmetrically Encrypted Integrity Protected Data packet,
        //        including prefix data, the tag octet, and length octet of the
        //        Modification Detection Code packet.
        //
        //    Note that the Modification Detection Code packet MUST always use a
        //    new format encoding of the packet tag, and a one-octet encoding of
        //    the packet length. The reason for this is that the hashing rules for
        //    modification detection include a one-octet tag and one-octet length
        //    in the data hash. While this is a bit restrictive, it reduces
        //    complexity.
