# qmake -> cmake wrapper for the Qt CI system
#
# DO NOT USE THIS UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING!
#
# This only supports a tiny subset of the CMake build system,
# hardcoded for the needs of integration with the Qt CI system.
#
# If you are building GammaRay yourself, please use CMake as
# described in Install. txt

# empty dummy file to make the CI not choke here
