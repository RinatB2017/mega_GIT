        // 5.7.  Symmetrically Encrypted Data Packet (Tag 9)
        //
        //    The Symmetrically Encrypted Data packet contains data encrypted with
        //    a symmetric-key algorithm.  When it has been decrypted, it contains
        //    other packets (usually a literal data packet or compressed data
        //    packet, but in theory other Symmetrically Encrypted Data packets or
        //    sequences of packets that form whole OpenPGP messages).
        //
        //    The body of this packet consists of:
        //
        //      - Encrypted data, the output of the selected symmetric-key cipher
        //        operating in OpenPGP's variant of Cipher Feedback (CFB) mode.
        //
        //    The symmetric cipher used may be specified in a Public-Key or
        //    Symmetric-Key Encrypted Session Key packet that precedes the
        //    Symmetrically Encrypted Data packet.  In that case, the cipher
        //    algorithm octet is prefixed to the session key before it is
        //    encrypted.  If no packets of these types precede the encrypted data,
        //    the IDEA algorithm is used with the session key calculated as the MD5
        //    hash of the passphrase, though this use is deprecated.
        //
        //
        //    The data is encrypted in CFB mode, with a CFB shift size equal to the
        //    cipher's block size.  The Initial Vector (IV) is specified as all
        //    zeros.  Instead of using an IV, OpenPGP prefixes a string of length
        //    equal to the block size of the cipher plus two to the data before it
        //    is encrypted.  The first block-size octets (for example, 8 octets for
        //    a 64-bit block length) are random, and the following two octets are
        //    copies of the last two octets of the IV.  For example, in an 8-octet
        //    block, octet 9 is a repeat of octet 7, and octet 10 is a repeat of
        //    octet 8.  In a cipher of length 16, octet 17 is a repeat of octet 15
        //    and octet 18 is a repeat of octet 16.  As a pedantic clarification,
        //    in both these examples, we consider the first octet to be numbered 1.
        //
        //    After encrypting the first block-size-plus-two octets, the CFB state
        //    is resynchronized.  The last block-size octets of ciphertext are
        //    passed through the cipher and the block boundary is reset.
        //
        //    The repetition of 16 bits in the random data prefixed to the message
        //    allows the receiver to immediately check whether the session key is
        //    incorrect.  See the "Security Considerations" section for hints on
        //    the proper use of this "quick check".
