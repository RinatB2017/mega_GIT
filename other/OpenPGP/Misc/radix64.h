    // 6.3.  Encoding Binary in Radix-64
    //
    //    The encoding process represents 24-bit groups of input bits as output
    //    strings of 4 encoded characters.  Proceeding from left to right, a
    //    24-bit input group is formed by concatenating three 8-bit input
    //    groups.  These 24 bits are then treated as four concatenated 6-bit
    //    groups, each of which is translated into a single digit in the
    //    Radix-64 alphabet.  When encoding a bit stream with the Radix-64
    //    encoding, the bit stream must be presumed to be ordered with the most
    //    significant bit first.  That is, the first bit in the stream will be
    //    the high-order bit in the first 8-bit octet, and the eighth bit will
    //    be the low-order bit in the first 8-bit octet, and so on.
    //
    //          +--first octet--+-second octet--+--third octet--+
    //          |7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0|7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0|7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0|
    //          +-----------+---+-------+-------+---+-----------+

    //          +--1.index--+--2.index--+--3.index--+--4.index--+
    //
    //    Each 6-bit group is used as an index into an array of 64 printable
    //    characters from the table below.  The character referenced by the
    //    index is placed in the output string.

    //       has two zero-value bits added to it, and is processed as above.  A
    //       pad character (=) is added to the output.
    //
    //    3. The last data group has 8 bits (1 octet).  The first 6-bit group
    //       is processed as above.  The second (incomplete) data group has
    //       four zero-value bits added to it, and is processed as above.  Two

    //    end of the data has been reached (without truncation in transit).  No
