            //    This is a flag in a User IDâ€™s self-signature that states whether this
            //    User ID is the main User ID for this key. It is reasonable for an
            //    implementation to resolve ambiguities in preferences, etc. by
            //    referring to the primary User ID. If this flag is absent, its value
            //    is zero. If more than one User ID in a key is marked as primary, the
            //    implementation may resolve the ambiguity in any way it sees fit, but
            //    it is RECOMMENDED that priority be given to the User ID with the most
            //    recent self-signature.

            //    self-signature on a User Attribute packet, this Subpacket applies
            //    only to User Attribute packets. That is to say, there are two
            //    different and independent "primaries" -- one for User IDs, and one
            //    for User Attributes.
