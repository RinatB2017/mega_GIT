            //    (N octets of flags)
            //
            //    This Subpacket contains a list of binary flags that hold information
            //    about a key.  It is a string of octets, and an implementation MUST
            //    NOT assume a fixed size.  This is so it can grow over time.  If a
            //    list is shorter than an implementation expects, the unstated flags
            //    are considered to be zero.  The defined flags are as follows:
            //
            //        First octet:
            //
            //        0x01 - This key may be used to certify other keys.
            //
            //        0x02 - This key may be used to sign data.
            //
            //        0x04 - This key may be used to encrypt communications.
            //
            //        0x08 - This key may be used to encrypt storage.
            //
            //        0x10 - The private component of this key may have been split
            //               by a secret-sharing mechanism.
            //
            //        0x20 - This key may be used for authentication.
            //
            //        0x80 - The private component of this key may be in the
            //               possession of more than one person.
            //
            //    Usage notes:
            //
            //    The flags in this packet may appear in self-signatures or in
            //    certification signatures.  They mean different things depending on
            //    who is making the statement -- for example, a certification signature
            //    that has the "sign data" flag is stating that the certification is
            //    for that use.  On the other hand, the "communications encryption"
            //    flag in a self-signature is stating a preference that a given key be
            //    used for communications.  Note however, that it is a thorny issue to
            //    determine what is "communications" and what is "storage".  This
            //    decision is left wholly up to the implementation; the authors of this
            //    document do not claim any special wisdom on the issue and realize
            //    that accepted opinion may change.
            //
            //    The "split key" (0x10) and "group key" (0x80) flags are placed on a
            //    self-signature only; they are meaningless on a certification
            //    signature.  They SHOULD be placed only on a direct-key signature
            //    (type 0x1F) or a subkey signature (type 0x18), one that refers to the
            //    key the flag applies to.
