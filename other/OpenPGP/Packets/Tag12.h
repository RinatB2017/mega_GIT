        //    The Trust packet is used only within keyrings and is not normally
        //    exported. Trust packets contain data that record the userâ€™s
        //    specifications of which key holders are trustworthy introducers,
        //    along with other information that implementing software uses for
        //    trust information. The format of Trust packets is defined by a given
        //    implementation.
        //
        //    Trust packets SHOULD NOT be emitted to output streams that are
        //    transferred to other users, and they SHOULD be ignored on any input
        //    other than local keyring files.
