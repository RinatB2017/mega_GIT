            //    The Features Subpacket denotes which advanced OpenPGP features a
            //    user's implementation supports.  This is so that as features are
            //    added to OpenPGP that cannot be backwards-compatible, a user can
            //    state that they can use that feature.  The flags are single bits that
            //    indicate that a given feature is supported.
            //
            //    This Subpacket is similar to a preferences Subpacket, and only
            //    appears in a self-signature.
            //
            //    An implementation SHOULD NOT use a feature listed when sending to a
            //    user who does not state that they can use it.
            //
            //    Defined features are as follows:
            //
            //        First octet:
            //
            //        0x01 - Modification Detection (packets 18 and 19)
            //
            //    If an implementation implements any of the defined features, it
            //    SHOULD implement the Features Subpacket, too.
            //
            //    An implementation may freely infer features from other suitable
            //    implementation-dependent mechanisms.
