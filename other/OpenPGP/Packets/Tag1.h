        // 5.1.  Public-Key Encrypted Session Key Packets (Tag 1)
        //
        //    A Public-Key Encrypted Session Key packet holds the session key used
        //    to encrypt a message.  Zero or more Public-Key Encrypted Session Key
        //    packets and/or Symmetric-Key Encrypted Session Key packets may
        //    precede a Symmetrically Encrypted Data Packet, which holds an
        //    encrypted message.  The message is encrypted with the session key,
        //    and the session key is itself encrypted and stored in the Encrypted
        //    Session Key packet(s).  The Symmetrically Encrypted Data Packet is
        //    preceded by one Public-Key Encrypted Session Key packet for each
        //    OpenPGP key to which the message is encrypted.  The recipient of the
        //    message finds a session key that is encrypted to their public key,
        //    decrypts the session key, and then uses the session key to decrypt
        //    the message.
        //
        //    The body of this packet consists of:
        //
        //      - A one-octet number giving the version number of the packet type.
        //        The currently defined value for packet version is 3.
        //
        //      - An eight-octet number that gives the Key ID of the public key to
        //        which the session key is encrypted.  If the session key is
        //        encrypted to a subkey, then the Key ID of this subkey is used
        //        here instead of the Key ID of the primary key.
        //
        //      - A one-octet number giving the public-key algorithm used.
        //
        //      - A string of octets that is the encrypted session key.  This
        //        string takes up the remainder of the packet, and its contents are
        //        dependent on the public-key algorithm used.
        //
        //    Algorithm Specific Fields for RSA encryption
        //
        //      - multiprecision integer (MPI) of RSA encrypted value m**e mod n.
        //
        //    Algorithm Specific Fields for ELGAMAL encryption:
        //
        //      - MPI of ELGAMAL (Diffie-Hellman) value g**k mod p.
        //
        //      - MPI of ELGAMAL (Diffie-Hellman) value m * y**k mod p.
        //
        //    The value "m" in the above formulas is derived from the session key
        //    as follows.  First, the session key is prefixed with a one-octet
        //    algorithm identifier that specifies the symmetric encryption
        //    algorithm used to encrypt the following Symmetrically Encrypted Data
        //    Packet.  Then a two-octet checksum is appended, which is equal to the
        //    sum of the preceding session key octets, not including the algorithm
        //    identifier, modulo 65536.  This value is then encoded as described in
        //    PKCS#1 block encoding EME-PKCS1-v1_5 in Section 7.2.1 of [RFC3447] to
        //    form the "m" value used in the formulas above.  See Section 13.1 of
        //    this document for notes on OpenPGP's use of PKCS#1.
        //
        //    Note that when an implementation forms several PKESKs with one
        //    session key, forming a message that can be decrypted by several keys,
        //    the implementation MUST make a new PKCS#1 encoding for each key.
        //
        //    An implementation MAY accept or use a Key ID of zero as a "wild card"
        //    or "speculative" Key ID.  In this case, the receiving implementation
        //    would try all available private keys, checking for a valid decrypted
        //    session key.  This format helps reduce traffic analysis of messages.
