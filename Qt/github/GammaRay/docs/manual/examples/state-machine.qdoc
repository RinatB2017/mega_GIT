    \brief Debug state machine runtime behavior
    \ingroup examples-gammaray

    This examples shows GammaRay's capabilities in analyzing state machine behavior at runtime.

    \section1 Problem

    The example application shows a simple traffic light with an on/off switch that is driven
    by a declarative StateMachine.

    We can observe that during its normal cycle it transitions from green directly to red, rather
    than going via yellow as one would expect.

    \section1 Investigation

    While the target application is running, open the \l{State Machine Debugger} view in GammaRay
    to observe the state machine layout, active configuration and configuration changes. It is
    easily visible that the green state is not transitioning to the greenToRed state as it is
    supposed to, but the red state directly.

    In order to fix this, right click on the green state, and select "Go to creation", which
    will open your code editor at the right spot in the corresponding source file.
